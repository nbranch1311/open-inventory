# Project Review 019: Pre-AI Gate Reopen for Dashboard UX/IA Follow-Up

**Date:** 2026-02-16  
**Reviewer:** Project Reviewer Agent  
**Scope:** Owner-directed follow-up on dashboard UX/IA after `T-008.10-QA` prior GO

---

## 1) GO/NO-GO Summary

| Area | Verdict | Blocking Findings |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Start `T-009-AI` now | **NO-GO** | Owner identified unresolved P0 usability issues in dashboard IA and post-onboarding space creation path |
| Execute `T-008.9a-UI` follow-up | **GO** | None |

Decision: **NO-GO** for immediate AI implementation.  
Decision: **GO** to execute `T-008.9a-UI` and re-run `T-008.10-QA`.

---

## 2) Blocking Findings

1. No explicit in-dashboard path for users to create additional Inventory Spaces after onboarding.
2. Space and room navigation separation creates avoidable workflow friction.
3. Control affordances (edit/delete/add) require clarity and accessibility alignment (icons, labels, tooltips).

---

## 3) Required Conditions to Unblock AI

`T-009-AI` may proceed only after:
1. `T-008.9a-UI` is complete,
2. `T-008.10-QA` is re-run and done,
3. Reviewer issues explicit GO for refreshed pre-AI usability baseline.
